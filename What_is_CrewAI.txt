🚀 What is CrewAI?

CrewAI is an open-source Python framework designed to make multiple AI agents work together as a team (“crew”) to solve complex tasks.

Think of it like this:
Instead of a single large language model (LLM) doing everything, you define a group of agents—each with a role, goal, and specialty—and CrewAI manages their collaboration and communication.

It’s like simulating a small company with:
👩‍🔬 A Researcher
✍️ A Writer
👨‍💼 A Reviewer
💻 A Coder
…all powered by AI.

🧠 How it Works
- Agents: Each agent is an LLM (like GPT-4, Claude, or local models) with a unique role, memory, tools, and goal.
- Crew: A group of agents working on a shared task.
- Tasks: Defined goals assigned to the crew; agents decide how to divide and complete them.
- Tools: Agents can use external APIs, databases, or functions (like web search, file I/O).

✨ CrewAI handles all the message passing, role coordination, and task orchestration between them.

📝 Simple Example

Say you want to summarize the latest AI research:
```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Find and summarize AI papers")
writer = Agent(role="Writer", goal="Draft a summary report")
reviewer = Agent(role="Reviewer", goal="Polish and check for accuracy")

# Create crew
crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer, reviewer])

# Run task
crew.run("Create a summary of AI breakthroughs in 2025")
```
Result: Researcher fetches papers → Writer drafts → Reviewer improves → Final summary delivered.
